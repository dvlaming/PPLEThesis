    "text": "Overview of the theme\nAmong general principles of law are the ideas of equality and the right to a fair hearing. These ensure that rules will be applied equally and objectively, and that disputes will be resolved without bias to the parties involved. However, those who draft and implement laws and make legal may be subject to biases (conscious or unconscious) based on intersectional factors such as identity, experience, and culture. This impacts a variety of contexts including statutory drafting, sentencing decisions, public policy and hiring practices. This raises the questions of how contradictions between law and psychology can be reconciled and which measures can be used to address (potential) biases in the law.",

    "text": "General advice\nGiven the thesis requirements in terms of time frame, word limits, and scope, topics should be narrowly tailored and psycholegal in nature. Projects should clearly identify (1) a specific case study/demonstrably impacted group that is (2) impacted by a law/policy/practice, which (3) directly connects to psychological theory.\nNote that projects that have encountered considerable difficulty have (1) examined generalized groups, (2) failed to measure a law’s impact, or (3) involved a legal decision/implementation that is based on more factors than can be coherently addressed within the scope of the thesis. In these cases, only weak and superficial analysis has been achieved, with poor grades as a result.",

    "text": "Methods\n\nPsychology majors\nProjects must primarily involve the analysis of quantitative data. Data can either be gathered as part of an original experiment (which will necessitate ethical review) or can be obtained from appropriate existing sources. At a minimum, projects will have demonstrable implications for the legal field, while outstanding projects will also integrate legal research methods (e.g., case analysis, doctrinal analysis). Psychology majors wishing to incorporate analysis of qualitative data as a secondary method are welcome to contact us but should be aware that we do not have methodological expertise in this area.\n\n\nLaw majors\nProjects must involve traditional, sociolegal, and/or empirical legal research methods. Law students can include mixed-methods approaches, such as qualitative interviewing, quantitative surveys, discourse/textual analysis, statistical analysis, and literature review. However, if civiel effect is sought, doctrinal analysis (traditional) must be included in approximately half of the thesis.",

    "text": "Selected past themes/topics\n\nHow does biased courtroom decisionmaking (from juries and/or judges) influence outcomes? This has been explored through analyzing psychological influences on witness credibility, verdicts, sentencing, damage awards.\nHow do ambiguities in written laws allow for biases in application? How does a law that appears to be neutral results in different impacts for specific communities?\nIn practice, how effective are laws designed to protect vulnerable communities?\nHow do laws reflect – or perpetuate – inequality when it comes to fundamental rights? This has been explored by examining differential treatment when it comes to parental rights (same-sex couples; single parents), founding a family (fertility treatments; surrogacy), laws based on sex/gender (governmental benefits; citizenship, asylum).\nWhat are societal attitudes towards implementation of particular laws? How have specific laws increased/decreased confidence in the judiciary?\n\n\nCiviel effect\nLaw students seeking civiel effect often ask about the types of questions they can explore. In recent years, they have done so with the following questions:\n\nHow does the use of facial recognition technology by the Dutch police interact with the fundamental rights to freedom of expression and assembly in the context of protests?\nHow can intergroup relations explain the differential treatment of farmers and Extinction Rebellion protesters by law enforcement, when enforcing Dutch Law on right to protest?\nHow have entrenched societal norms influenced the divergence of Curaçaoan law from human rights standards concerning same-sex adoption?\nShould California eliminate the inclusion of juvenile adjudications in the three strikes law considering the insights from developmental psychology that form the foundation of the juvenile justice system?\n\nMore detailed information (and data) on selected theses is available in the following pages. While we are experienced in supervising projects related to Bias and Objectivity, we also welcome enquiries from students wishing to apply insights from Law and Psychology outside of this theme. For questions, please contact us (Madeline Hendricks and David Fleming) by email.",

The Right to Protest in the Panoptic Reality: A Psycho-Legal Analysis of the Use of Facial Recognition Technology by the Dutch Police in the Context of Protests\nThe study investigated whether awareness of the use of Facial Recognition Technology (FRT) by the Dutch police would affect perceptions of rights to freedom of expression and assembly. The main research question was: ‘How does the use of facial recognition technology by the Dutch police interact with the fundamental rights to freedom of expression and assembly in the context of protests?’ Furthermore, a specific subquestion was developed which relates to the collected data: ‘How does awareness of the use of FRT by the Dutch police affect individual attitudes towards exercising freedom of expression and assembly?’ The main hypothesis was that ‘[a]wareness of the use of FRT does affect attitudes towards exercising freedom[s] of expression [and] assembly.’",

    "text": "Rough summary of the main measurement items and procedure\nParticipants completed a Qualtrics survey in which they were initially asked to rate their agreement to four Likert scale questions relating to how capable, safe and willing they feel in expressing their thoughts and opinions on matters which they find important, and on their likelihood of doing so. These terms were also used for questions relating to the act of attending a protest (e.g., ‘[i]n general, I would be willing to assemble [e.g. participate in protests] in the Netherlands in support of matters that are important to me’), for eight questions in total. After completing these, participants were shown two informational passages which described the extent of video surveillance coverage in the Netherlands and the use of FRT by the authorities. Afterwards, they again completed eight questions, as before covering the themes of capability, likelihood, safety and willingness, directed towards expression of opinions and physical protest attendance. Here, however, the question statements were modified to invite participants to think about the impact that the information which they had just read had on their views of their own freedom of assembly and expression (e.g., ‘[k]nowing when and how FRT can be used by the Dutch police has a … effect on my willingness to assemble [e.g. participate in protests] in the Netherlands in support of matters that are important to me.’)\nIn the ‘pre-text’ phase, the response items were measured on a five-point Agree/Disagree scale with a neutral “Neither agree nor disagree” midpoint (3), where scores greater than 3 indicate agreement; in the “post-text” phase, the five points reflected the participant’s report of how their prior ratings had changed after reading the presented information, with a midpoint response indicating no effect, and values higher and lower than this reflecting positive and negative effects, respectively.\n\n\nAssociated files\n\nThesis\nData in SPSS (.sav) format and R (.RDS) format\nQualtrics design",

    "text": "2. Redemption or Rejection? Legal Protections and Psychological Barriers in Hiring Ex-Offenders\nThe study investigated whether an ex-convict’s crime and the manner in which they disclose it on their CV affect their likelihood of being hired. Study participants were asked to rate the likelihood of their hiring a fictional ex-convict after being presented with a CV which contained information about the crime committed (simple assault vs. tax evasion), and which either gave a basic, factual statement of the crime (‘plain’ narrative) or a statement which included discussion of the steps taken on the part of the applicant to rehabilitate themselves post-detention (‘redemption’ narrative). The main research question was: ‘How do an ex-offender’s crime type and disclosure strategy influence hiring likelihood, and what does this reveal about the effectiveness of rehabilitation protections, using Germany as a legal reference case?’ The principal hypotheses were:\n\nThose previously convicted of tax evasion would be rated as more likely to be hired than those convicted of assault.\nThis effect would flow indirectly through the mediator of perceived applicant trustworthiness.\nThe indirect effect would be moderated by disclosure strategy, such that a “redemption” narrative would have a larger impact on trustworthiness when the candidate had previously committed tax evasion.\n\n\nRough summary of the main measurement items and procedure\nParticipants entered a Qualtrics survey in which they were randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions:\n\nTax evasion with ‘plain’ narrative\nTax evasion with ‘redemption’ narrative\nSimple assault with ‘plain’ narrative\nSimple assault with ‘redemption’ narrative\n\nThe experimental vignettes featured the CV of a male candidate applying for a position as bus driver, where all information was held constant across conditions except for the crime and narrative information. Participants rated their agreement with questions relating to the trustworthiness of the candidate on a six item scale (with one reverse-coded item) running from 0 (strongly disagree) to 100 (strongly agree) and subsequently rated how likely they would be to hire the candidate (‘[b]ased on the application you read, how likely would you be to hire this candidate for a bus driver position?’), also on a scale of 0 (extremely unlikely) to 100 (extremely likely). Two items relating to general belief in redeemability of offenders and a bipolar measure of of political orientation (0 = very left wing, 100 = very right wing) were collected for use as model covariates, as were the participants’ age and gender.\n\n\nAssociated files\n\nThesis\nData format\nQualtrics design",
